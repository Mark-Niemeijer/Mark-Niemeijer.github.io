    <h1>Naval warfare game</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
      For my first internship I worked on a modern naval battle game for the thales group. This was a game made in unity. During this project I worked on multiplayer components, 
      specifically with the Mirror API. This included object/value synchronasation, as well as working with partial information only known to one or the other player (for example, the position of a player being known to one player but their position not being known to the other).
      I also worked with a second one that allowed the game to be hosted and joined through steam. Furthermore I worked on pathfinding within the game for AI
      ships. For this I used the build in components of unity.
