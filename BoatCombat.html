    <p style="font-size: 20px;">For the course Immersive Technologies and Storytelling (IMTS) I worked as a programmer in a team on an assignment from the Leiden University Medical Center. For this assignment we were asked to create a realistic operating room where instructors could 
      put a variety of situations before anaesthesiologists and respond to how they would handle the situation.
