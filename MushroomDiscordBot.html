  <p>For the course Immersive Technologies and Storytelling (IMTS) I worked as a programmer in a team on an assignement from the Leiden University Medical Center. 
  In this project my main responsibilities were networking data between trainer and trainee, implementing VR interactions for the player to use the computer in the room, and helping with the networking between trainees.</p>
