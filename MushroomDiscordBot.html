  <h1>Mushroom discord bot</h1>

  <p>The mushroom bot started of as a simple joke program requested by a friend. Over time I added multiple text reactions to the bot. I decided I wanted to try something more with it and so I build a small game in it.
    This is the game hangman, where-in any amount of players can come together to try and guess the word that mushroom picks from a long list. 
    The players can guess in turn a letter or the entire words but have a shared amount of allowed guesses</p>
