  <h1>Mushroom discord bot</h1>
  <img src="Images/Mushroom Hangman.png" alt="Hangman game start">
  <p>The mushroom bot started of as an one note joke program which peaked my inspiration to try and build interesting things in with discord as a limitation.</p>
  <p>One of these is the game hangman, where-in any amount of players can come together to try and guess the word that mushroom picks from a long list. 
    The players can guess in turn a letter or the entire words but have a shared amount of allowed guesses</p>
