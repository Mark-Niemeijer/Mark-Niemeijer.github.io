    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Rad games is a VR game about being in a competition to see how long you can survive in a cave holding of monster with your sword guns. This game was made as a project for Oyfo Kunstenschool en Techniekmuseum Hengelo. The project started as a request fromt the oyfo to create games to teach/educate people about polution and the enviroment.
    We got the oppertunity to work with the HTC Vive for this project. Through the development of the project the polution side became more of a side focus over making a compelling game. The oyfo was still happy with the game, as a VR experience drew people to the museum.
    I was  programmer on this project who specifically worked on the monster AI, tools to design and control the waves in which they spawned and a few minor elements</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">The final game can be downloaded <a href="https://mark0191.stackstorage.com/s/nqlID2JbFgFuhWB">here</a></p>
