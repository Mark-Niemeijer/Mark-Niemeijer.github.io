  <p style="font-size: 20px;">In order to improve my knowledge on AI opponent behaviour in gaming I wanted to learn a behaviour for moving groups of agents together by studying the flocking behaviour. 
  In this small project I created a small arena where two groups of agents have to move past eachother while staying close to their group. The agents are spawned in and then given a predetermined end point. With the help of the unity path finding system I calculate a path from the start towards the end and get a series of locations the agents must go to.
  The agents follow a set of simple rules that when combined, create the behaviour of flocking together while moving towards a target. These rules are:</p>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">1. Rotate towards the center of the group</p>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">2. Rotate away from any other members of the group</p>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">3. Rotate towards the waypoints that lead to the goal</p>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">4. If another group gets too close, rotate away from the center of the other group</p>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">After all these rules excuted, their rotations are combined and this decides where the agent should look towards. The agent then moves forward in the direction it is looking. There are a few exceptions that overrule these 3 rules. Should an agent move to far away from the rest of the group then the agent gets told to return to the center of the group and to ignore the other rules. This makes sure they do not go off on their own and breakt he group cohession.</p>
