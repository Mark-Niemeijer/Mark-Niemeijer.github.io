  <p>Project New Earth is a third person ship combat game where 2 players fight splitscreen against eachother to control specific points on the map.</p>
  <p>For this project my main responsibility was the AI, both for computer controlled ships to help the players as well as turrets who would defend points after they were captured.</p>
