    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Project New Earth was the third shared project we did for school. In this game you control a ship in third person where 2 players fight splitscreen against eachother to control specific points on the map. They do this by using their laser weapons or firing rockets which lie around the map. For this project my main responsibility was the AI, both for computer controlled ships to help the players as well as turrets who would defend points after they were captured.</p>
