  <p style="font-size: 20px;">I wanted to learn how to use fusion 2, a libary for multiplayer in video games. In order to get a grip on it I made a small first person shooter using this system. 
  I use fusion to connect players with eachother using their master server, making it easy to connect to people without having to share IP-Adresses. 
  When every player that has joined presses the ready button the level gets loaded in. Players can move around using the WASD keys and look around with the mouse. 
  If they press the left mouse button the gun fires and if the other player gets hit they take damage. After 3 hits the opponent dies and gets respawned on pre defined spawning points. 
  Pressing the TAB key will show a leader board with how many kills each player has. There are also health packs in the level that can be picked up to restore HP.</p>
