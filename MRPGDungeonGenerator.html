  <p style="font-size: 20px;">Another project which I wanted to make in the discord bot was a small rpg with generated levels. 
    For that I created a system which can generate rooms of differing sizes randomly spread out, use pathfinding to find the shortest path to connect them with hallways favouring using existing hallways, 
    and then generate an image representing the map by combining images for each tile into one big map.</p>
